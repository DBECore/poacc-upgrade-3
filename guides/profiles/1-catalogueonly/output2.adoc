= Introduction to openPEPPOL and BIS

This BIS is a result of work within openPEPPOL and is published as part of the PEPPOL specifications.

This PEPPOL BIS provides a set of specifications for implementing a PEPPOL business process.
The document is concerned with clarifying requirements for ensuring interoperability of pan-European Public eProcurement and provides guidelines for supporting these requirements and how to implement them.
This PEPPOL BIS is based on the CEN WS/BII2 “Profile BII01 Catalogue Only”.

*The purpose* of this document is to describe a common format for the catalogue message in the European market, and to facilitate an efficient implementation and increased use of electronic collaboration regarding the sourcing process based on this format.

= Principles and prerequisites

[[business-process-in-scope]]
== Business Process in scope

This PEPPOL BIS supports a process for suppliers to send a catalogue and for buyers to return a catalogue response.
It is intended to support transmission of electronic catalogue-messages for processing in semi-automated processes by the receiver.
The BIS mandates no procurement related data but supports different ways of referring to products and services.
By selective use of such references it can be used as basis for automated processing of ordering and invoicing.

The intended scope for this BIS is:

* B2B and B2G
* Common business processes for cross industry and cross border procurement
* Regional procurement within EU and EEA
* For supporting purchase of goods and services and/or services that can be itemized.

This PEPPOL BIS supports a set of “common use cases / process”. These are processes that are used widely or understood as being relevant for most companies.

The main activities supported by this BIS are:

* Description of goods and services
* Maintaining content of framework contract
* Item comparison
* Item dependency and composition
* Description of packaging and storage requirements
* VAT classification
* Item instance description
* Maintenance of catalogue

This PEPPOL BIS supports requirements by providing elements for information needed to meet the requirement.
This BIS also provides a set of business rules to clarify content and implementers can use them as basis for validation where it provides business value.

[[peppol-bis-1a---benefits]]
== PEPPOL BIS 1A - Benefits

Catalogues are used as basis for maintenance of information about products and services that are part of a contract, like a framework agreement.

* The buyer (or a catalogue provider on his behalf) can present the information in a web shop where he can ensure correctness of product description, prices and other terms that may apply.
* The supplier can provide the customer with correct information at all times and ensure high data quality in orders based on the catalogue he prepares.
* Implementing the catalogue provides the possibility of designing fully automated purchasing flows in which the electronic documents can be validated and matched automatically, thereby saving resources compared to manual processing.
* Implementation of a catalogue can be the first step in automating the purchasing process followed by an order and an invoice, leading to entire purchasing process running from sourcing, ordering and invoicing to payment.
* Buyers can accept or reject the catalogue using a catalogue response

This PEPPOL BIS is based on the CEN/ISSS WS/BII Profile BII01 specification, see [BII_Catalogue].

*Requirement*


a|

tbr19-058


 a|

All transaction (catalogue and responses) must contain all information necessary

for its application i.e. it shall not rely on the availability of external references such as a centralised repository of item information.
To ease the processing of a catalogue or a response, as no external data sources are needed.


a|

tbr19-059


 a|

It must be possible to check the integrity and authentication of the information

 a|

*Requirement*


a|

tbr19-071


 a|

A catalogue transaction must contain an identifier for the catalogue it represents or updates


a|

tbr19-001


 a|

An indicator for the catalogue revision may be specified.
To support updating the


| a|

catalogue after the first submission a revision indicator is sometimes needed to

differentiate the catalogue versions.
This indicator ensures the catalogue provider (CP) and catalogue receiver (CR) always refer to the correct and valid version of the catalogue.


a|

tbr19-002


 a|

It must be possible to specify a name of the catalogue.
Some catalogues have a

special name used in the common communication.
Sometimes the name refers to a special event the catalogue is created for.


a|

tbr19-003


 a|

It must be possible to specify the period of time the catalogue is valid.
A catalogue

without a stated validity period is assumed to be valid until it is cancelled.
Sometimes products are offered only for a certain period of time or the prices for the product are assured to be fixed by the CP only during this period of time.


a|

tbr19-006


 a|

It must be possible to specify the contract on which the catalogue is based on.

Sometimes a catalogue is provided according to a contract, e.g., a framework agreement (FWA). In such a FWA further requirements on the catalogue may be specified.
A catalogue transaction either refers to one contract/agreement or none.


a|

tbr19-007


 a|

The party providing the catalogue must be specified.
To check, if the catalogue

comes from or is sent on behalf of the right CP.
The party may be the supplier or a dedicated third party acting on behalf of the supplier.


a|

tbr19-010


 a|

The party receiving the catalogue must be specified.
To check, if the catalogue

sent to the same CR as specified in the catalogue.


a|

tbr19-015


 a|

It must be possible to specify who offers the items described in the catalogue and

how this party can be contacted (mail, e-mail, phone, etc.). Only one supplier is allowed to be specified.
As the catalogue provider can differ from the supplier itself, e.g., the supplier outsourced all catalogue services to a catalogue provider, the supplier has to be specified as well.
This party is the actual Economic Operator the Contracting Authority is doing business with.


a|

tbr19-062


 a|

A catalogue must have information that makes it possible to reference specific

instances of the catalogue.


a|

tbr19-066


 a|

The party that sells the products that are listed in the catalogue must be identifiable with information including name, address, identifiers as well as contact

information.


a|

tbr19-067


 a|

be identifiable with information including name and identifiers as well as contact information.


a|

tbr19-075


 a|

It must be possible to specify whether a catalogue is new, to be updated or to be

replaced.


|====

[[item]]
==== Item

[cols=",",options="header",]
|====
a|

*ID*


 a|

*Requirement*


a|

tbr19-040


 a|

An item in a Product or Service Catalogue must have a name and be uniquely

identifiable by at least one single language-independent token.
This includes such id provided by the CP itself as well as a manufacturer's id and an id coming from standard identification schemes.
Ensure that the item can be referenced, e.g., in the order.
The id can be used in the order, which makes it easier to process the order by the supplier and helps to deliver the correct item that was ordered by the buyer.


a|

tbr19-050


 a|

It must be possible to specify how the item has to be processed by the catalogue

receiver.
This includes the following options: adding the item to the catalogue, replacing an existing item in a catalogue sent before, and deleting an item in a catalogue sent before.
If no action is specified it has to be considered as a new item.
It is intended to provide a synchronization mechanism between the catalogue of the catalogue provider and the catalogue receiver.


a|

tbr19-041


 a|

It must be possible to specify the period of time the item is valid.
If no validity

period is specified, the item description is valid until it is cancelled.
The same as in tbr19-003, but on the item level.
This allows to have items with different validity periods in the same catalogue.
Otherwise, for every a validity period a separate catalogue would need to be provided.


a|

tbr19-018


 a|

It must be possible to refer an item to the corresponding classes from one or more

classification systems.
Often, the usage of a classification system, e.g., CPV, UNSPSC, eCl@ss, or GS1 GPC, is mandatory or widely used in practice.
By this requirement, it should be possible to use any classification systems mandated by Contracting Authorities or legal frameworks.


a|

tbr19-019


 a|

It must be possible to specify the (semantic) relationships and cardinalities between different items in the catalogue.
In particular, in must be possible to

specify part-of relationships and required (additional) items.
Some items are not offered by a supplier individually.
They are either only useful together with another item or refer in some manner to a specific item.
Examples for such items are accessories belonging to and only applicable with another item or replacement

items to replace broken components of an item. (In future version of BII other

relationships may be added, e.g., replacement items, complementary items, or accessories.)


a|

tbr19-042


 a|

It must be possible to specify, if and how an item can be ordered.
This includes

allowed units of measure, order sizes, minimal and maximal order sizes, etc.
Due to restriction from the production process or to simplify or to limit the costs of the ordering and logistics process the order size is restricted.
Thus, the buyer needs information to place a correct order that is not denied by the supplier.


a|

tbr19-023


 a|

It must be possible to specify how the delivered items will be packaged.
To

indicate from which number of ordered order units this package unit will be delivered.


a|

tbr19-029


 a|

It must be possible to specify hazard indicators for an item by any indicator

system.
If an item can be a danger to people or the environment, so called hazardous goods, often legal requirements demand that such items have indicators to indicate the danger that come from this item.
Furthermore, such items require special handling in the logistics process.


a|

tbr19-030


 a|

It must be possible to specify logistic conditions and other needed service

information on how the item will be delivered.
This includes information on maximum and minimum storage temperature, information needed for cross-border logistics processes.
To define the work or services to be done for each package unit along the supply chain.


a|

tbr19-033


 a|

It must be possible to specify the manufacturer of the item.
In particular, for the case where the supplier is different from the manufacturer of the item.


a|

tbr19-034


 a|

It must be possible to specify how the item is priced, and what VAT percentage

applies.
This includes factors that have influence on the price as well as relationships to other parts of the catalogue that may have impact on the price.

The price is not always fixed, but dependent on many factors, e.g., order size,

delivery region (down to the city level), allowance, charges, currency, etc.
Prices must not be negative.


a|

tbr19-046


 a|

The price specification must allow to compare the prices of different items within the catalogue as well as across catalogues.
To allow the comparison of the price of different items.
Helps the buyer to make the buying decision.


a|

tbr19-048


 a|

It must be possible to specify the period of time an item price is valid.
If no validity period is specified, the price is valid until cancelled.
The same as in tbr19-003, but on the item level.
This allows to have items with different validity periods in the same catalogue.
This does not mean, that the item will expire.
It only means, that after this period the item has to be ordered for a different price.


a|

tbr19-049


 a|

It must be possible to specify a delivery location on line level, with address, city,

post code, etc., so that all details on each line are dependent on this location, including price, tax and other specifications.
Needed to support the buying decision, to see how much has to be paid in the end.


a|

tbr19-035


 a|

It must be possible to provide information on the product marking, e.g., to indicate

that environmental or social requirements on the item production were followed.
Procurement managers need information about environmental marking applicable for a given item in order to ensure that environmental, ecological, food safety and basic human rights aspects were respected.
On the other side, sales managers wish to provide this kind of information, e.g., for marketing purposes.


a|

tbr19-043


 a|

It must be possible to specify if and when an item becomes obsolete.
This allows

the suppliers to indicate that an item is not produced and delivered any more or until a certain point in time.
By giving this information, it is prevented that the buyer orders items that will not be delivered any more.
This requirement has a different meaning than tbr19-048.
Tbr19-048 concerns the validity of the price.
In tbr19-043 the “validity” refers on the item, i.e., product or service, when it will not be available.
This means, the item itself will not be available and delivered by the supplier any more (to any condition).


a|

tbr19-044


 a|

It must be possible to specify a description of the item or where such a description

can be found.
To provide a written text describing the item.
May be helpful for the buyer to order the items fitting his needs best.


a|

tbr19-045


 a|

It must be possible to specify keywords for an item.
To support searching for an

item by the buyer, so that the item can be found easier and faster that fits his needs best.


a|

tbr19-047


 a|

It must be possible to specify warranty information for the item.
Sometimes

suppliers offer specific warranties for their items that may be important for the buyer.
Providing such information supports the buying decision.


a|

tbr19-063


 a|

A catalogue must have information that makes it possible to reference individual

catalogue lines.


a|

tbr19-064


 a|

A catalogue line must provide for an indicator that clearly states whether the line

item can be ordered according to the information given in the line.


a|

tbr19-065


 a|

A catalogue line must provide for additional information about items in the form of

attachments and external references.


a|

tbr19-068


 a|

It must be possible to specify a manufacturing date, a best before date and an expiry date (last date when product may be used or consumed) for an item.


a|

tbr19-069


 a|

It must be possible to specify serial numbers, batch numbers and lot numbers for

an item.


a|

tbr19-070


 a|

It must be possible to include or reference (e.g. by means of a URI) the main

image for an item.


a|

tbr19-072


 a|

In addition to part-of relationships and required (additional) items there is also a

need to identify replaced item.
In cases where an old item is replaced by a new one this is frequently reflected in the catalogue by deleting the old item and adding the new item.
The new item should then have a reference to the old (replaced) item.


a|

tbr19-073


 a|

Products are frequently sold with optional accessories.
In addition to part-of

relationships and required (additional) items there is also a need to identify these optional accessories in the catalogue.


a|

tbr19-076


 a|

It must be possible to state the country of origin for an item.


a|

tbr19-077


 a|

It must be possible to indicate that the item is part of a contractual arrangement.

 a|

It must be possible to specify any additional properties of the item not covered by

the message itself.
Allows to enhance the description of the item and helps this way, inter alia, the buyer to order the item that fits his needs best.


a|

tbr19-037


 a|

It must be possible to refer an item property to any property from a product/service classification system, using standardized and predefined properties from accepted

standards.
Such predefined properties help to improve the description of an offered item, and thus helps the buyer to order the correct item, the item that fits his needs best.


a|

tbr19-039


 a|

If an item property is specified, a specific value has to be specified for this item

property.
The specified value has to hold true for the corresponding item.
The specification of a concrete value helps to ensure that the buyer orders the item that fits his needs best.

[[other-key-elements]]
== Other key elements

[[action-code]]
=== Action code

The Action code holds instructions about the treatment of the Catalogue by the recipients system.
The Action code can be stated either on header or line level.
Please be aware that the below mentioned are codes, and hence the correct use of upper and lower case must be used.
Example: Replace is valid, REPLACE is not valid.

Legal codes on Catalogue header level:

* Add – Used when a catalogue is sent for the first time to the Catalogue Receiver referring to the contract in the header of the catalogue.
* Replace – Replaces the entire catalogue referring to the contract.
This is the default action.
* Update – Updates a current catalogue.
* Delete – deletes the entire catalogue
+
Example : <cbc:ActionCode listID="ACTIONCODE:PEPPOL">Replace</cbc:ActionCode>

Legal codes on Catalogue Line level:

* Add – Used to add items to the catalogue.
* Update – Used to update an item.
The entire Catalogue Line is updated.
Only used if Action code on header level is Update
* Delete – Used to delete an entire Catalogue line.
Only used if Action code on header level is Update.


It is important to note that when updating or deleting on line level, the key identifier is the item ID (sellers item identification or standard item identification, see chapter 10.2.2.), not the line ID.
If CatalogueLineReference is used in the corresponding order message (outside scope of this BIS), the numbering of Line ID must be consistent in all versions of the catalogue.


Example:

<cbc:ActionCode listID=”ACTIONCODE:BII2”>Update</cbc:ActionCode>

[[item-identification]]
=== Item identification

Item identification must be sent using the identifiers described below.

* Sellers item identification
* Standard item identification, e.g. GTIN
* Manufacturers item identification which is necessary when the same product is bought from several suppliers.

Either Sellers item identification or Standard item identification must be sent.
Manufacturer’s item identification shall be sent if available.
Which identifier to use depends on what is known at the time of catalogue exchange or what is commonly used in the relevant business sector.

Example 1, Sellers item identification:

<cac:SellersItemIdentification>

<cbc:ID>2451015</cbc:ID>

</cac:SellersItemIdentification>

Example 2, Standard item identification:

<cac:StandardItemIdentification>

<cbc:ID schemeID="GTIN">05790000436040</cbc:ID>

</cac:StandardItemIdentification>

[[hazardous-item]]
=== Hazardous item

If an item is classified as Hazardous item, a reference to the relevant UNDG-code must be stated and further specification must be provided in an attached document or on a web-site (URI).

Example:

<cac:HazardousItem>

<cbc:UNDGCode listID=”UNCL8273”>3265</cbc:UNDGCode>

</cac:HazardousItem>

[[item-name-and-description]]
=== Item name and description

The Item name shall be sent in tag <Item/Name> on line level.
It is the short description of an item commonly used in ERP-systems.
An item name should make it possible for the user to distinguish between similar items.
The Item name is often sent in the order from buyer to seller.
The field length could be an agreement between parties, to make sure the supporting systems can handle the length.

<Item/Description> is used to provide additional relevant description of the item, in free text.

Example:

<cac:Item>

<cbc:Description> Ballpoint pen, comes in different colours and tip sizes</cbc:Description>

<cbc:PackQuantity unitCode="CT" unitCodeListID=”UNECERec20”>10</cbc:PackQuantity>

<cbc:Name> Ballpoint pen.
Blue colour 0.7 mm</cbc:Name>


</cac:Item>


[[classification]]
=== Classification

An item may be classified according to UNSPSC being the mandatory public classification schemes in some countries/sectors.
Products can also be classified according to regulatory schemes or classification schemes used in certain business sectors.
The type of classification shall be stated in the attribute “listID”. In some cases there is a need to add the name of the Item classification Code by using the attribute “name”

Example:

<cac:CommodityClassification>

<cbc:ItemClassificationCode listID="UNSPSC">44121701


</cbc:ItemClassificationCode>


</cac:CommodityClassification>

[[keyword]]
=== Keyword

Keywords are sent to let the Buyer search for an item without knowing the item identification or name.
Keywords tag can be repeated (0..n), but the number should be limited to ensure correct handling in the receiving system.

It is also possible to send several keywords in the same tag, by using a separator between the different keywords.
Which separator that should be used, must be agreed between the parties.
Example of a separator can be the %-sign, as this is not used anywhere else.

Example of several keywords by using several <KeyWord>-tags:

<cac:Item>

<cbc:Description>Day cream</cbc:Description>

<cbc:PackQuantity unitCode="EA">50</cbc:PackQuantity>

<cbc:Name>Ultimate Day cream, 250 ml</cbc:Name>

<cbc:Keyword>Moisturizer</cbc:Keyword>

<cbc:Keyword>Balm</cbc:Keyword>


<cbc:Keyword>Lotion</cbc:Keyword>


<cac:SellersItemIdentification>

[[peppol-identifiers]]
= PEPPOL Identifiers

PEPPOL has defined a “Policy for Using Identifiers” [PEPPOL_Transp] that specifies how to use identifiers in both its transport infrastructure and within the documents exchanged across that infrastructure.
It also introduces principles for any identifiers used in the PEPPOL environment.
The following policies apply to this BIS:

[[party-identifiers]]
== Party Identifiers

The “schemeID” attribute must be populated in all instances of the “ID” element when used within a “PartyIdentification”-container and in all instances of the “EndpointID” element when used within a “Party”-container.

Example of using GS1 GLN (Global Location Number) as PartyIdentification:


<cac:PartyIdentification>

<cbc:ID schemeID="GLN">4035811991014</cbc:ID>

</cac:PartyIdentification>


[[using-danish-organization-number-as-partyidentification]]
=== Using Danish organization number as PartyIdentification

In Denmark parties often are identified by a company organization number.
This can be used for all parties.

The following examples denotes that the Issuing Agency is DK:CVR in the PEPPOL set of Issuing Agency

Codes.
This means that the party has the Danish CVR identifier DK87654321.

Examples of usage in PartyIdentification and Endpoint ID:


<cbc:EndpointID schemeID="DK:CVR">DK87654321</cbc:EndpointID>

<cac:PartyIdentification>

<cbc:ID schemeID="DK:CVR">DK87654321</cbc:ID>

</cac:PartyIdentification>


[[using-swedish-organization-number-as-partyidentification]]
=== Using Swedish organization number as PartyIdentification

In Sweden parties often are identified by a company organization number.
This can be used for all parties.

<cac:PartyIdentification>

<cbc:ID schemeID="SE:ORGNR">5541277711</cbc:ID>

</cac:PartyIdentification>

[[using-italian-vat-number-as-partyidentification]]
=== Using Italian VAT number as PartyIdentification

In Italy parties often are identified by the VAT number.
This can be used for all parties.

<cac:PartyIdentification>

<cbc:ID schemeID=" IT:VAT"> IT01234567890</cbc:ID>

</cac:PartyIdentification>

[[version-id]]
== Version ID

This BIS is using the UBL 2.1 syntax.
The namespace of the XML-message does only communicate the major version number.
Since it is important for the receiver to also know what minor version of the syntax that is used, the element UBLVersionID must be stated with the value *2.1:*

<cbc:UBLVersionID>2.1</cbc:UBLVersionID>

[[profile-id]]
== Profile ID

The ProfileID identifies the process that the business document is part of.
PEPPOL BIS uses the identification system according to BII:

The following process identifier is used for the transactions of this BIS:

**ProfileID**: urn:www.cenbii.eu:profile:bii01:ver2.0

For implementers: Please note that process identifiers in the document instance MUST correspond to the

SMP process identifier.

[[customization-id]]
== Customization ID

The PEPPOL Customization ID identifies the specification of content and rules that apply to the transaction.

This BIS has required some minor additions and changes to the CEN BII transaction.
Following the CENBII methodology any extension must be communicated by adding an extension ID onto the Customization ID.
The full syntax is: <transactionId>:(restrictive|extended|partly):<extensionId>[(restrictive|extended|partly):<extensionId>].

Where:

* Transaction ID: urn:www.cenbii.eu:transaction:biitrns019:ver2.0
* Extension ID: urn:www.peppol.eu:bis:peppol1a:ver4.0

*CustomizationID to use for cataglogue transaction:*

urn:www.cenbii.eu:transaction:biitrns019:ver2.0:extended:urn:www.peppol.eu:bis:peppol1a:ver4.0

*CustomizationID to use for cataglogue response transaction:*

urn:www.cenbii.eu:transaction:biitrns058:ver2.0:extended:urn:www.peppol.eu:bis:peppol1a:ver4.0

Example of usage:

<cbc:CustomizationID>


urn:www.cenbii.eu:transaction:biitrns019:ver2.0:extended:urn:www.peppol.eu:bis:peppol1a:ver4.0

</cbc:CustomizationID>


For implementers: Please note that CustomizationID element in the document instance MUST correspond to the Customization ID of the SMP Document Identifier.

[[namespaces]]
== Namespaces

The target namespace for the UBL2.1 Catalogue is:

*urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:schema:xsd:Catalogue-2*

The target namespace for the UBL2.1 Catalogue response is:
