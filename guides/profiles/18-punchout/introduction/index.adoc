= Introduction to openPEPPOL and BIS

This BIS is a result of work within openPEPPOL and is published as part of the PEPPOL specifications.

This PEPPOL BIS provides a set of specifications for implementing a PEPPOL business process.
The document is concerned with clarifying requirements for ensuring interoperability of pan-European Public eProcurement and provides guidelines for supporting these requirements and how to implement them.
This PEPPOL BIS is based on the CEN WS/BII Profile “BII Profile 18 Punch out CWA 17029-110” {bii3}.

*The purpose* of this document is to describe a common format for the shopping cart in the European market, and to facilitate an efficient implementation and increased use of electronic collaboration regarding the ordering process based on this format.
