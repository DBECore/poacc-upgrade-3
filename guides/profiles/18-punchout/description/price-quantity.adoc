[[prices-and-quantities]]
= Prices and quantities

Each line in the Shopping Cart must show the number of items that have been selected by the buyer.
For each item there must be a price.
The price must be given for the same units as the quantity but the number of units that the price is based on may be different than the quantity.

As example.
A buyer may select 360 pieces of an item where the price is €24 for each dosen (12 pieces). In this case the item unit is pieces, and the price for each piece is €24/12 or €2 for each item.
Base quantity is optional, with default value 1; when someother base quantity applies it must be stated..

In the shopping cart message this information would be given as follows:
