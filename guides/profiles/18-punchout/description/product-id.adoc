[[product-identification]]
= Product identification

Which identifier to use depends on what is known at the time of ordering or what is commonly used in the relevant business sector.

Each cart line MUST have an item name and an identifier.
Product identification must be done using one or both of the identifiers described below:

* Sellers ID
* Standard ID, e.g. the GS1 Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) used by the seller [GS1]

Manufactureres item identification can not be used alone to identify a product.
The Product name must be sent in tag Item/Name on line level.

Example of an PEPPOL BIS Shopping Cart item using both Sellers ID, Manufacturers ID and Standard ID (GTIN):

<cac:Item>

<cac:StandardItemIdentification>

<cbc:ID schemeID="GTIN">1234567890123</ID>

</cac:StandardItemIdentification>
