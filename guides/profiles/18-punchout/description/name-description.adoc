[[item-name-and-description]]
= Item name and description

Description of a product can be sent in Item/Description.

The Product name is sent in the shopping cart from buyer to seller.

Example in an PEPPOL BIS Shopping Cart message:

The Name is preferably short so that it is suitable for use in a order or invoice line or as a heading.
A description allows for longer text that describes the item in detail.
