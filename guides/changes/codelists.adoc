= Code list changes

* All party identifiers from ISO 6523 ICD list.
** ICD list to 0189 + 0192, this is not matching TC434 validation
** Code 0092 and 0103 removed, as they are marked unused
** Report mismatches to TC434?
* Allowance and charge split in different types (5189 and 7161)
** Code not used in other transactions - add elements?
* Item Classification code = UNCL7143 - UNSPSC not in the list
* Standard item identifier -ICD list -> full list allowed?
* Mimecode is now a "merge" between TC434 and codes used in catalogue.

* Order agreement:
